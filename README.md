This project was something I’ve wanted to build for a long time, and it came to life by chance when I was assigned the task at work. I was really excited and motivated to work on it because it provides a real service with a meaningful impact. The system allows:

Admin: To manage doctors and patients, including adding and editing doctor profiles.
Patients: To book appointments with doctors.
Online Payments: Payment functionality (pending).
The most exciting part for me was the ability to build something complete and functional, especially the user interface (UI). I thoroughly enjoyed designing the doctor list, appointment booking system, and filtering by specialties. I also created a full navigation system, including a header, footer, and sections for different parts of the site.

Challenges & What I Liked
Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was time management, as I am primarily a front-end developer, and working on this project required me to stretch my backend knowledge. Although I have some experience in backend development, I didn’t manage to complete certain features, like creating the middleware for managing permissions and securing the admin and doctor pages.

What I Liked
I loved how well the Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS combined to create an elegant and responsive UI. The overall architecture of the project using Next.js and Prisma with PostgreSQL made the development process smoother.

Pending Tasks
Implement middleware to manage user permissions (Admin, Doctor, Patient).
Complete the online payment integration.
Finish the admin dashboard for managing doctor and patient data.
Improve the back-end functionality for better performance and security.
